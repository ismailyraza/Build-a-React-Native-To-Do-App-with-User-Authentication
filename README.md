Before diving into the code, let's outline the project structure
css
# Key Components
Authentication:
Firebase Authentication or implement a custom authentication system.
Create screens and components for user registration, login, and password reset.

State Management:
use React's built-in state for simpler apps, or can use a state management library like Redux for more complex applications.

Task Management:
Create components for displaying a list of tasks (TaskList), individual task items (TaskItem), and adding tasks (AddTask).
Implement the ability to mark tasks as completed and delete tasks.

Navigation:
Use React Navigation to create a navigation stack that includes authentication screens and the main app screens.

Services:
Implement service modules (e.g., authService and taskService) to handle API calls and interact with your backend (if you choose to implement one).
Backend (Bonus):

Use appropriate UI components like buttons, lists, and input fields for a consistent and user-friendly interface.
Enhancements (Bonus):

Add due dates, task categories, sorting, and filtering features as needed.
Implement additional features to enhance the user experience.

# For Creating full React Native To-Do App with User Authentication app

First, setting up a new React Native project:
npx react-native init MyToDoApp
cd MyToDoApp

Installing necessary dependencies:
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler @react-native-community/async-storage firebase
npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth

Create a Firebase configuration file (firebaseConfig.js)

# Authentication: 

Install Firebase Dependencies:
npm install --save @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth
